## Concepts 

- ReactDOM which handles the rendering of our application's components onto specific pieces of the application's html.
- react-bootstrap package to style components.
- Constructor() and super() combination which allows components to have dynamic state.
- Passing data through props allows components to recieve data from their parents.
